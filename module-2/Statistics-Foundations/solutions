## Challenges
### Challenge 1
One player rolls two dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. The values that the player obtains.
* B. The sum of the values obtained.
* C. The maximum value obtained after rolling both dice.

Describe the following events:
* Case A: Both values are greater than 5.
* Case B: The sum of values is even.
* Case C: The maximum is the value of both rolls.

### Solutions Challenge 1
**A.** 
Possible outcomes are {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)...} 
**B.** 
Possible sum of values obtained are {2, 3, 4, 5... 12} 
**C.**
Possible maximum values are {1,2,3..6}

**Case A:**
{(6,6), (6,6)}
**Case B:**
{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}
**Case C:**
{{1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)}

### Challenge 2
One player picks two cards from a poker deck. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. The number of figures he picks.
* B. The sum of card values. Consider that the value of figures is 10 and the value of aces is 15.
* C. The number of hearts or spades he picks.

Describe the following events:
* Case A: The number of figures in the cards the player picked is two.
* Case B: The sum of card values is 17.
* Case C: The value of both cards is less than 8.

### Solutions Challenge 2
**A.** 
Possible figures are: jacks, queens, and kings. There are three of each (one for each of the four suits), with a total of 12 figures. A standard deck of cards has 52 cards. 
NF = No Figure/Face
F = Figure/Face
{(NF, F), (F,NF), (F, F), (NF,NF)}
**B.** 
{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... 30}
**C.**
There are 13 of each suit, so 26.
H = hearts
S = spades
N = neither
{(S, H), (S, S), (H, H), (H, S), (N, S), (N, H), (S, N), (H, N), (N, N)}

**Case A:**
{(F, F), (F,F)}
**Case B:**
{(1, 16), (2, 15), (3,14),(4,13),(5,12),(6,11),(7,10),(8,9),(9,8),(10,7),(11,6),(12,5),(13,4),(14,3),(15,2),(16,1)}
**Case C:**
{(1,1),(1,2),...(1,7),(2,1)...(2,7),(3,1)...(3,7),(4,1)...(4,7),(5,1)...(5,7),(6,1)...(6,7),(7,7), (7,1)... etc. 

### Challenge 3
Two players roll a dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. The score of player A.
* B. The greatest score.
* C. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:  
"The player with the greatest score gets a coin from the other player.".
* D. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:  
"The player with the greatest score gets as many coins as the difference between the score of player A and player B.". 

Describe the following events:
* Case A: The score of player A is 2.
* Case B: The greatest score is lower or equal than 2.
* Case C: Considering the case where the winner gets as many coins as the difference between scores (D), describe: 
  * Player A wins at least 4 coins.
  * Player A loses more than 2 coins.
  * Player A neither wins nor loses coins.


### Solutions Challenge 3
**A.** 
{1,2,3...6}
**B.** 
{2,3,4,5,6} Assuming there are no ties.
**C.**
{1}
**D.**
{0,1,2,3,4,5}
**Case A:**
{2}
**Case B:**
{2}
**Case C:**
Player A wins at least 4 coins: {(5,1),(6,2)}
Player A loses more than 2 coins: {(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4)...(2,6),(3,6),(4,6)}

## Bonus challenges
### Bonus Challenge 1
Three players take balls from a box. Inside that box there are red, blue, green and black balls. The players can take three balls at mosts with the following rules:

* If the ball is blue, they can take another ball.
* If the ball is green, they get one point and they can take another ball.
* If the ball is red, they can’t take another ball.
* If the ball is black, they lose one point and they can’t take another ball.

Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. Player A wins. Do not consider ties as a win.
* B. Player A and B get the same points.
* C. All players get 0 points.

### Bonus Challenge 2
Consider the situation of bonus challenge 1 but now with four players. Does anything change in your solutions? What are the changes in each case?

### Bonus Challenge 3
One player takes three balls from a box. Inside the box there are 5 balls: two of them are black and the other three are white. 

Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:
* A. The number of white balls if every time we take a ball we keep it.
* B. The number of white balls if every time we take a ball we put it back again into the box.
* C. The number of black balls if every time we take a ball we keep it.
* D. The number of black balls if every time we take a ball we put it back into the box.
