*"Clean" variable naming:

Lower case
Use _ to separate words
Consistency: lower case functions

From PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code:

"Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
Variable names follow the same convention as function names."


*Meaningful "object" naming:

Think of function, description, and how variable relates to rest of the code. 
Start with narrow description, moving towards more broad descriptions: "measured_height_value," for example. 
Avoid technical type information in the object name. 

From https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application_development/9781786469250/1/ch01lvl1sec8/creating-meaningful-names-and-using-variables: 

"When creating a descriptive variable, we want to create names that are both specific and articulate the relationships among things in our programs. One widely used technique is to create longer names in a style that moves from particular to general."

*Blank spaces:

From https://realpython.com/python-pep8/#code-layout

"Surround top-level functions and classes with two blank lines."
"Surround method definitions inside classes with a single blank line."
"Use blank lines sparingly inside functions to show clear steps."



*Indentation:


*Comments: 

Use '''method for multi-line comments, having the closing ''' on a separate line.
